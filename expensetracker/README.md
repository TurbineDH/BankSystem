# Expense Tracker
This little project uses Python as base language and PyQt5 as the interface framework.
This project helped me get an idea of UI building and basic SQL database.

# What it is:
This application uses a database to store the history of purchases of a person/company.
The transactions are divided in different categories aswell as have their own date and amount of items purchased.
The database can of course be modified to fit plenty of necessities.
